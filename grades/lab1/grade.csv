ShanaKim,"Data cleaning: Does missing include or not include NA values such as 91/92? More specificity is needed. Does essentially the bare minimum, changing NA labels and the like. Needs to check internal validity of data - multiple columns based on the same information do not agree with one another.
EDA: Rather than using encoded variable names such as PosIntFinal, tables should be made human-readable by using ciTBI or other well-defined words/acryonms.
Finding 1: Finding is very interesting - I appreciate that you are looking at the subset with ciTBI instead of just looking at correlation, since this gives us an interesting view. Figure should have some sort of human-readable features on the x-axis ticks instead of things such as HA_verb or SFxBas
Finding 2: Figure has same issue as the one from Finding #1, but won't double-penalize for it.
Finding 3: Missing an extra layer or a ""so what"". Would have been really cool to see this tie into the difference in risk for boys vs. girls that Dr. Kornblith discussed in his talk.
Reality check: Need to cite sources if you are going to use them like this!
