Code Style - check the applicable boxes,"Reproducibility of report. You don't have to actually run anything, but is it clear to you based on what is in the ""code"" folder how all the figures/results in the report were produced? Would it be easy to reproduce them? If not, discuss why.

(Since I'm not asking you to run anything, I haven't provided any additional items students may have put in their ""data"" folders, but if e.g. the code refers to '../data/some-input-file.csv', pls assume it exists)",How easy would it be for you to use their code to clean the data the same way they did? Is there an easy-to-use function in a separate file?,Readability of report (Was the narrative clear and easy to read? Or did you find it hard to follow? Any grammar mistakes?),Discuss the data cleaning (Was the cleaning described in detail? Were there any inconsistencies in the data that were missed?),Relevance of figures - excluding findings (were the figures relevant and discussed in the report?),"Quality of figures - excluding findings (Were the figures easy to understand? Was there a caption? Were the axes labeled? Were they visually appealing? If not, what would you have changed?)",Finding 1 Quality (Discuss the quality of the figure),Finding 2 Quality (Discuss the quality of the figure),Finding 3 Quality (Discuss the quality of the figure),Discuss the reality check (Was the reality check convincing? Was it clearly described?),Discuss the stability check (Was the check relevant to the finding(s)? Did it help to convince you that the finding corresponds to a real phenomenon?),Additional comments/feedback?
"Sufficient comments are included to understand code., Consistent style is used.",Yes,"Very easy, all I have to do is run one function that is contained in clean.py.",The report was clear and readable all the way through. ,Data cleaning procedure is clearly outlined and the methods are consistent,Figures are relevant and are mentioned in the text.,"Figures are generally easy to understand, but there are no figure numbers or captions. I would rotate the x axis labels on the figures in the data exploration section.",Overall the figure is easy to interpret and is visually appealing. Some of the longer x axis labels are hard to read/associate with a bar due to its placement on the figure.,"The figure is clear, but maybe the data could be sorted in some way to show certain trends.",It should be made clear whether this is a stacked histogram or if the bars are overlaid. Using percentages in addition to raw counts could be more informative so that there can be an apples to apples comparison for the rates of ciTBI between the sexes in this cohort.,"The reality check was convincing, but would cite the ""established research"" mentioned.",The stability check strengthens the findings from data exploration due to the consistent results.,Please add figure/table numbers and captions since it makes it easier to refer to them in the text (and in the feedback form).
"Sufficient comments are included to understand code., Consistent style is used.",Yes it is reproducible,Yes it is easy,Yes it is readable.,The author didn't discuss inconsistencies but only removed some columns that would cause inconsistencies. Other parts are good.,Yes they are relevant,Missing captions.,Would be better if the features in this figure are ranked,Would be better if the features in this figure are ranked,Good,Good,The table here has misaligned header.,Name should not be attached. Screenshot of model performance should not be attached.
