They also used visualizations for the training models, which was very helpful for understanding what was happening at a glance.","The narrative was clear, logically structured, and easy to follow throughout the report. The explanations were concise and well-articulated, making it easy to understand the motivation and implementation behind each section. There were only a few minor grammatical errors, none of which significantly impacted the readability. Overall, it maintained a strong academic tone and was professionally written.","All the figures included in the report were relevant and well-integrated into the narrative. They were used to support observations and model decisions rather than just presenting raw outputs. Each figure was discussed in the surrounding text, showing how it contributed to the analysis. This made the technical content much more digestible and meaningful.","The figures were well-designed and generally easy to understand, with appropriate captions and labeled axes. Visualizations like heatmaps, box plots, confusion matrices, and ROC curves were effective and informative. A few graphs (like Figure 3) could have benefited from slightly clearer labeling or legends for accessibility. Still, they were overall visually appealing and supported the report’s claims well.",3,3,"The autoencoder section was well-documented, detailing architectural changes and hyperparameter tuning clearly. The justification for model choices and the exploration of different structures showed a solid understanding of model complexity and trade-offs. Their choice of the final model was supported by validation performance, making the decision convincing. It’s evident the autoencoder added valuable embedding features that contributed to performance gains.",4,"The authors provided a solid rationale for using LightGBM, citing its efficiency and scalability. They detailed hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation strategy, and class imbalance handling clearly. The results were thoroughly evaluated and compared with alternative models. Their reasoning for selecting LightGBM as a final model was data-driven and well-supported.",4,"The KNN model was implemented thoughtfully, and assumptions were clearly laid out. The use of normalization, careful selection of K, and analysis of distance weighting showed attention to detail. Although KNN underperformed compared to other models, the explanation for its inclusion and parameter tuning was clear. It demonstrated a solid understanding of the algorithm’s strengths and limitations.",3,"XGBoost was presented as a flexible alternative to LightGBM, and the reasons for its inclusion were well justified. The discussion of its unique hyperparameters and cross-validation process showed depth. Performance metrics were compared directly with LGBM, and log-loss convergence plots helped illustrate overfitting tendencies. The rationale for ultimately favoring LGBM over XGBoost was compelling and clearly communicated.","The stability checks were well-designed and relevant to evaluating model robustness. Both noise injection and bootstrap sampling were explained clearly, and the consistency of results supported the model’s generalizability. Confusion matrices and metric tables provided concrete evidence. These tests strengthened the credibility of the final model under different conditions.","The evaluation of the final model was thorough and convincing, with strong justification based on performance metrics and log-loss behavior. Visual comparisons, feature importance plots, and post-hoc EDA provided additional evidence supporting the model’s effectiveness. They acknowledged potential biases from data imbalance and assessed model generalization effectively. Overall, the process was well-described and strongly supported their model selection.",

However could not find code for image 14, so that would be hard to reproduce(perhaps i just couldnt find it).","Yes, it seems like it would be generally easy to use this code, there are relevant scirpts, and the overall code structrue is very clear. Only thing missing to improrve readablity would be a READ.me but this was not wasked for. ","Did not find any grammar mistakes, and the narrative seemed clear.","The figures are relevant to the report's content, but they lack sufficient analytical discussion. The authors present visualizations without explaining their significance or implications. Key questions remain unanswered: Why do we see these patterns? What insights can we extract from these distributions? What conclusions support the modeling decisions? The figures appear more as documentation than as analytical tools driving insights. ","I feel like a lot of the images where small and hard to read. This is odd because they where not near the the page limit, so they had the space to make the images larger. The figures have some inconsistent formatting and lack detailed captions explaining their significance. Color choices often have poor contrast, making distinctions difficult to see. Many visualizations are overcrowded with information, obscuring key insights.",3,3,"The report documented the changes made to the autoencoder, but it lacked justification or hypotheses for these changes. The authors mentioned various techniques but did not explain why each technique was chosen, what problem it was intended to solve, or how it impacted the model. As a result, it is difficult to assess whether their training procedure was thoughtful or effective. Stronger reasoning and interpretation of their decisions would have made the section better.",2,"The authors provide minimal justification for their LightGBM model choices. They mention using grid search across learning rates and number of leaves with cross-validation, but don't explain why these specific parameters or ranges were selected.Their observation that LGBM shows ""more stable and consistently decreasing validation log-loss"" lacks deeper analysis of why this occurs or its implications for their application. The class imbalance issue is acknowledged but not addressed in their model design decisions.",4,"Consider strengthening the KNN section by justifying the locality assumption and K=[3,10] range more rigorously within the context of this cloud data. Additionally, explaining the observed shift in optimal parameters (K and weighting) when incorporating the autoencoder features would add valuable insight. Except for this it was good",4,the only critique here is that yhey don't leverage any of XGBoost's specialized capabilities for handling imbalanced data (like scale_pos_weight) despite acknowledging class imbalance in their dataset. ,"Yes, the stability checks using noise addition and bootstrapping are relevant and effectively bolster confidence in the final model's robustness against data variations, supporting its potential generalization.","The final model evaluation is thorough and clearly described, providing a convincing justification based on comprehensive metrics and validation behavior for selecting LGBM as the best model",Nope
