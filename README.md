## Projects

### 🧠 Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury Prediction (Lab 1)
- Built ML-ready datasets from **43,000+ patient records**, reducing 125 clinical variables to 55 key predictors
- Conducted exploratory data analysis and visualized clinical risk factors
- Trained and evaluated multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LDA/QDA, SVM)
- Achieved **>85% predictive accuracy** for clinically important TBI while emphasizing interpretability

### ☁️ Cloud Detection in Polar Regions (Lab 2)
- Developed a full ML pipeline for cloud detection using **200+ satellite images**
- Applied **unsupervised feature extraction with deep autoencoders (PyTorch)**
- Compared classical and learned representations across multiple classifiers
- Achieved **92%+ test accuracy** and **ROC-AUC above 0.98** with robust evaluation

### 🧠📖 Language-to-Brain Modeling with fMRI (Lab 3)
- Modeled voxel-level fMRI brain responses using linguistic stimuli across **100,000+ voxels per subject**
- Built scalable ridge regression pipelines with large-scale cross-validation
- Compared Bag-of-Words, Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT embeddings
- Fine-tuned **BERT with LoRA** and applied **SHAP/LIME** for interpretability of semantic brain responses
