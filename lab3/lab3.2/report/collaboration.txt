Soohyun Kim
Organized group meetings, set internal deadlines, and assigned tasks to team members.
Completed Part 2 and wrote the corresponding report section (entire 3. Modeling & Evaluation).
Proofread the final documents, reorganized files for submission, and pushed the final results to GitHub.

Tianrui Yang
Read the references and was responsible for the construction of the four model architectures in encoder.py and the two important functions in train_encoder.py.
Actively organized and participated in the group discussions, and started the skeleton of the report. 
Wrote Section 2.1, 2.2 and the Academic honesty part of the report. Helped proofread and refine the details of other parts of the report.

Yujian Zhou
I revised encoder files to integrate stories as input and help debug the loss function. 
I tuned hyperparameters, plot curves, generated embeddings and wrote the corresponding part in our final report. 
Besides, I wrote environment and run.sh files and help manage the git repo.

For this lab, I worked on Part 1 (pre-training). I modified the encoder’s input data to use the same stories as in Lab 3.1. I added an option for validation in the training loop (train_encoder.py) and used the same training/validation split as Lab 3.1. 
I also added plots of the training and validation loss curves. 
Additionally, I fixed bugs in the training loop to ensure it outputs valid loss values instead of NaNs. 
For the report, I wrote the Introduction and Section 2.3, and I revised the grammar and sentence structure throughout the report.
